        Perhaps you don’t like the double-underscores or double-dashes thing.
        Fine, use something else that is unique that you will consistently enforce.
        To wrap things up I think it’s fair to say that even though BEM won’t solve all our problems it is extraordinarily useful for
        constructing scalable and maintainable interfaces where everyone on the team should have a clear idea of how things can be improved.
        This is because a great deal of front end development is not just about the nice tricks that solve one little problem in the short term;
        we need agreements, promises and binding social contracts between developers so that our codebase can adapt over time.

        This navigation demo has 1 block, 6 elements and 1 modifier. It’s even perfectly OK to create blocks without modifiers at all.
        At some point in the future a developer can always bolt on (or bind to) new modifiers so long as the block remains consistent.
        Not to pick on Samuel here, but his sentiments are shared by a lot of people so it makes for a good example.
        They see BEM, and they just outright reject it.
        If you want to dislike BEM, that’s absolutely fine, but I think it would be hard to argue that having a set of rules that aid in understanding and assist in keeping CSS maintainable is a bad idea.
